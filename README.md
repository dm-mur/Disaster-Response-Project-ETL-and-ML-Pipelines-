#### Disaster-Response-Project-ETL-and-ML-Pipelines-
This project is part of the fulfillment of the requirements for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree in partnership with Appen (formerly Figure Eight).

Key Sections of the Project:

1. Data Processing and ETL Pipeline:
Creation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to extract data from the source.
Cleaning and preprocessing of the data to prepare it for model training.
Saving the cleaned data in a SQLite database for easy access and retrieval.

2. Machine Learning Pipeline:
Development of a machine learning pipeline to train a model capable of classifying text messages into various categories.
Training the model using the cleaned data to ensure accurate classification.

3. Web Application Development:
Creation of a web application to showcase the model's results in real-time.
Providing users with an interface to input messages and receive classification results instantly.
The dataset used in this project contains pre-labeled tweets and messages from real-life disaster events, providing valuable insights into effective disaster response strategies.

By leveraging NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to enhance disaster response efforts by efficiently categorizing and prioritizing incoming messages, thereby enabling rapid and effective decision-making during critical situations
