#### Disaster-Response-Project-ETL-and-ML-Pipelines-
This project is part of the fulfillment of the requirements for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree in partnership with Appen (formerly Figure Eight).

Key Sections of the Project:

1. Data Processing and ETL Pipeline:

Creation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to extract data, preprocess for modelling and load the clean data in a SQLite database.

3. Machine Learning Pipeline:
*pending
Development of a machine learning pipeline for classifying text messages into various categories.

4. Web Application Development:
*pending
Creation of a web application to showcase the model's results in real-time.
Providing users with an interface to input messages and receive classification results instantly.

The dataset used in this project contains pre-labeled tweets and messages from real-life disaster events, providing valuable insights into effective disaster response strategies.
By leveraging NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to enhance disaster response efforts by efficiently categorizing and prioritizing incoming messages, thereby enabling rapid and effective decision-making during critical situations
